# Overview

As a Software Engenieer it is vital to continue learning and exploring new programing languages and technologies. This application created with Android Studios was created as a way to challenge myself and continue my learning.

This is a Task Manager app which allows you to add and delete tasks.

I created this app primarily as an introduction to mobile app development. This is the first mobile app I've created and is a demonstration of what I have learned.

# Development Environment

To create this App I used Android Studios, programming in both xml and Java. Kotlin is a rising mobile app development language but I decided to stick with Java for simplicity. When developing Android apps there are numerous libraries that can be used.
